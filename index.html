            <p class="funParagraph">When approaching a new situation, a new crowd, a new place, I like to think most everyone’s inner voice whispers “don’t be weird”. Mine did, and I kept my mouth shut in fear of what I might say. I felt hidden, alone, and even more weird. After a bit of growing up, a series of abnormal events we will not get in to for now, and a change of scenery, I realized it was time I scratched out the “don’t” from my inner monologue. It was embarrassing at first, but it was freeing and it was fun. Once you’ve really embarrassed yourself once, I mean like REALLY embarrassed yourself, nothing really feels so bad after that.

         This webpage isn’t meant to be anything cohesive or special, it is just a place for me to be weird and to show off where my weirdness has gotten me. Embracing the quirky, the odd, has led me to the most amazing people. Maybe I can inspire someone with my journey. The more weird of us together, the better anyway.
